# Metal Plays Proxy/BFF (Backend for Frontend)

The Metal Plays BFF layer serves as a dedicated and simplified access point for a Spotify user's currenty playing and recently played tracks.

This BFF uses the Spotify API and the Authorization Code workflow to prompt the user for authorization and access before making the `played` and `current` endpoint available.
